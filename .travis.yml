# Definition of global variables. These include:

#   - DOCKER_IMAGE: the name of the ROOT docker image.
#   - DOCKER_CONTAINER: internal name to identify the docker
#       container with the ROOT docker image.
#   - KLF_SOURCE_DIR: location of the KLFitter source code.
#   - KLF_BUILD_DIR: directory to be used for the KLFitter build.
#   - CMD_DOCKER: command to be appended to other shell commands
#       when executing them in the docker image.
#   - CMD_EXPORT_BATINSTALL: command to export the variable
#       BATINSTALLDIR within the docker image.
#   - CMD_EXPORT_LIBPATH: command to export the library paths
#       within the docker image. The command appends to an
#       existing LD_LIBRARY_PATH and adds the library locations
#       for ROOT, BAT, and KLFitter.

# Definiton of the actual CI jobs. We build KLFitter with three
# different scenarios:
# 1. Make a fully automatized build of KLFitter and BAT using
#    cmake. This downloads and compiles BAT via cmake, and builds
#    and links KLFitter against it. Run unit tests afterwards and
#    verify their output.
# 2. Download and compile BAT with the external shell script
#    CompileBAT.sh. Then configure the KLFitter build via cmake
#    and pick up that pre-built version of BAT. Run unit tests
#    afterwards and verify their output.
# 3. Download and compile BAT with the external shell script
#    CompileBAT.sh. Then use the Makefile to build KLFitter and
#    link it against the pre-built version of BAT. Run unit tests
#    afterwards and verify their output.
